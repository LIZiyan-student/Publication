Abstract: 
Motivated by the recent experimental detection of superconductivity in AB-stacked and ABC-stacked graphene, we study the critical temperatures Tc and order parameters (OP) in multi-layer graphene based on the Kohn-Luttinger-Like mechanism. We assume that the acoustic phonon induced charge oscillation contributes the most to the screened electron-electron interaction between Cooper pairings, leading to the emergence of superconductivity in these non-twisted graphene systems. The metallic gates screening and electron-hole excitation are also considered to fully investigate the screening effect. We compare the calculated Tc in graphene with different stacking methods and find that rhombohedral-stacked (ABC and ABCA) graphene perform higher critical temperatures in the order of 100mK. The higher density of state (DOS) peaks appearing in these rhombohedral-stacked graphene systems strongly account for their higher Tc. We further explore the order parameters which change sign within each valley and display inter-valley A2 symmetry, indicating the f-wave or p-wave superconductivity in multi-layer graphene systems.
